## Welcome to my server ðŸ’»


This is a little bit of what I am!:

ðŸ’» 
A systems engineering professional with solid experience in cybersecurity, vulnerability management with tools such as Qualys, system hardening based on CIS guidelines, and administration of solutions such as Netskope, Microsoft Intune, and firewalls (Fortinet, Palo Alto, CheckPoint), and IPS/IDS systems (Snort, Suricata), DDoS attack protection systems, sandboxes, and antispam. I also have experience managing Active Directory, security controls, authentication and authorization methods, and identity management tools in on-premises and cloud environments (Azure, AWS).

I am currently focused on strengthening my skills in ethical hacking and pentesting, delving deeper into vulnerability exploitation techniques, privilege escalation, pivoting, and control bypass using tools such as Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, and OWASP ZAP. I have basic scripting knowledge (Python, Bash, PowerShell) for test automation. I actively participate in CTFs and platforms such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and OffSec Proving Grounds to hone my penetration testing skills in web and mobile applications, APIs, AD, and cloud infrastructures. Familiar with ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP, I seek to contribute to projects that integrate offensive and defensive strategies to protect critical assets.
